# Phantom Analyzer
Phantom Analyzer was a tool we [launched](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/phantom-analyzer) during Halloween 2020. It's a much simpler version of [Blacklight by The Markup](https://themarkup.org/blacklight) and we had so much fun running it for a year. We've decided to retire it, and open-source the code to let people either host it themselves, or simply learn how to run Browsershot on Laravel Vapor. This tool is perfect for companies who might want a quick way to audit vendors or companies they're working with.

## Note
This codebase is not actively maintained.

## Requirements
The following requirements are how we ran Phantom Analyzer.

* PHP 7.4
* [Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com/)
* AWS account

You absolutely can run it outside of Vapor, but we haven't tested that, so it's on you :)

## Instructions

1. Create a new project in Laravel Vapor
2. Put your Vapor Project ID into the vapor.yml file
3. (optional) Add a [custom domain](https://docs.vapor.build/1.0/projects/environments.html#custom-domains) to your vapor.yml file
4. Run `vapor deploy production` or `vapor deploy staging`
5. In Vapor, run `phantom:cache_spy_pixels` to populate DynamoDB (default cache driver) with the spy pixel list
6. Celebrate üçæ

## Updating the spy pixel list
You can add/remove values from the spy pixel list any time you want. We seldom do this, so we hard-coded things, but you can do it.
1. Update `resources/trackers.txt`
2. Open `app/Jobs/ScanWebsite.php` and increase the VERSION constant (e.g. 0.2 becomes 0.3)
3. Deploy to Vapor
4. Run `phantom:cache_spy_pixels` in the Vapor environment to populate the new values

## FAQ
**Question:** What is Laravel Vapor?

**Answer:** If you've never used Laravel Vapor before, but you're curious, take the [Serverless Laravel](https://serverlesslaravelcourse.com/) course and master Laravel Vapor.

**Question:** Who built Phantom Analyzer?

**Answer:** We did. [Fathom Analytics](http://usefathom.com/) is a privacy-first analytics solution founded by [Jack Ellis](https://twitter.com/jackellis) and Paul Jarvis.

##

**Question:** I have an issue, where can I get help?

**Answer:** The reason we disabled issues on here is because we just don't have the capacity to offer support on this project. We'd recommend asking on [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com), Stack Overflow or in the [Serverless Laravel](https://serverlesslaravelcourse.com/) slack group.

**Question:** Why are spy pixels bad?
